# Code-Ingene
Code Ingene is a coding assessment platform for students. Teachers can log in/sign up and create a classroom. Teachers can then add students to the classroom. Once students are added, the teacher can assign a coding task for all students in the classroom (only). No student outside the classroom can access it until the teacher adds him to the class. Students can access the tasks in their dashboard/portal. He can then click on the task and start solving the problem using a code editor provided by Code Ingne.
